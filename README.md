A Notation3 Editor in JavaScript

You can find an online demo here: [http://ppr.cs.dal.ca:3002/n3/editor](http://ppr.cs.dal.ca:3002/n3/editor)

Using the [latest Notation3 grammar](https://github.com/w3c/N3/blob/master/grammar/README.md), 
I generated a JS lexer, parser and listener using the ANTLR tool support. 
See [here](https://github.com/w3c/N3/blob/master/grammar/README.md#creating-the-js-parser) for more information.

I then used the JS parsing code to flag errors for a [CodeMirror lint-enabled editor](https://codemirror.net/demo/lint.html). 
For syntax highlighting, I re-used the [Turtle mode](https://codemirror.net/mode/turtle/index.html),
extending it with Notation3 keywords. 

The editor has a neat "show AST" function that will print the AST generated by the JS parsing code.

In lieu of a JavaScript Notation3 reasoner, 
I created [a simple server](https://github.com/william-vw/n3-editor-js/blob/master/app.js)
that is called by the editor whenever "execute" is clicked. The server will execute the given formula using 
either the [Eye](https://github.com/josd/eye) or [Cwm](https://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html) system. 
It can easily be configured with additional systems, when they become available.
